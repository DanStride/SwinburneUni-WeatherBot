# Swinburne University Assignment

## Weatherbot Pro

This project is for the Swinburne University Programming and Development Graduate Course.

Weatherbot Pro is a prototype chatbot running in a Flask framework which will access weather information for a specific itinerary and respond based on user input for a given day and valid location.
Only locations in the itinerary will work and the bot can only respond with data for up to seven days in advance.

To run the application:
1. Clone the project
2. Open the project with PyCharm (or your preferred editor)
3. Install dependencies
4. Overwrite env.py with the file I supply for you
5. Run

The API key is stored in the env.py file and must be overwritten with the file I supply for you in order for the app to work (unless you want to supply your own)
